# hello-world
First GitHub repository of a newly started career as a successful developer.
I am a loving father of two beautiful girls (looking to be the father of one more beautiful child), a lucky man married to a wonderful woman, an amateur writer with aims of writing a book and a passionate self-taught developer starting a succesful career.
